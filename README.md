### Project Overview: Face Recognition and Data Scraping Application

This project is a **Go-based application** designed to interact with **MongoDB**, process image data, and scrape **VK (VKontakte) profiles**, with a primary focus on **face recognition**. It integrates several libraries to handle various tasks, including MongoDB interactions, image processing, and web scraping. The application utilizes advanced face recognition technology through **dlib** and also features a **C interface** for external integration. 

The project is composed of two major components: **web scraping and data collection** and **face recognition and processing**. Below, we will focus on explaining the **face recognition** feature in more detail.

### Core Features:

#### 1. **Face Recognition with dlib**:
The heart of the project is **face recognition** using **dlib**, a powerful machine learning library. This component is capable of detecting faces, aligning them, and recognizing unique features in each face. The face recognition process is broken down as follows:

- **Face Detection**: The application uses **dlib’s frontal face detector** to identify faces within a given image. The faces are represented as **rectangles** (bounding boxes) in the image.
  
- **Face Landmarking**: For each detected face, the application uses **dlib’s shape predictor** (`shape_predictor_5_face_landmarks.dat`) to find key facial landmarks (such as eyes, nose, and mouth). These landmarks help align and normalize the faces for better recognition.

- **Face Recognition**: After detecting and aligning faces, the application utilizes **dlib’s ResNet-based recognition network** to compute a **128-dimensional descriptor** (also called a feature vector) for each face. These descriptors uniquely represent each person’s face and can be used for facial matching and comparison.

- **Thread-Safe Execution**: The face recognition process is designed to be thread-safe using **mutexes** to ensure that face detection and recognition operations do not conflict when multiple faces are being processed simultaneously.

- **C Interface**: To make the face recognition functionality accessible to external applications, the project provides a **C interface**:
  - `facerec_init`: Initializes the face recognition system, loading the required pre-trained models.
  - `facerec_recognize`: Accepts image data, detects faces, and computes face descriptors.
  - `facerec_free`: Frees any allocated resources when the face recognition system is no longer needed.

This face recognition feature is central to the project and makes it suitable for applications like identity verification, surveillance, or any system requiring reliable face recognition.

#### 2. **MongoDB Integration**:
The application interacts with **MongoDB** using the **mgo** library to store and manage data. MongoDB serves as a data store for:
  - **Face recognition results**: The bounding box coordinates of detected faces and their corresponding feature vectors (descriptors).
  - **VK scraping results**: Information scraped from VK profiles, such as URLs and other profile data.

MongoDB operations include:
  - **Creating indexes** for efficient querying (on fields like `rectangle`, `vector`, and `url`).
  - **Inserting and retrieving data** related to image recognition and scraped data.

#### 3. **Web Scraping (VK Profiles)**:
The application also includes a **web scraping module** that uses the **scrape** library in Go to collect data from VK (VKontakte) profiles. The scraping process involves:
  - Extracting profile data, such as URLs, images, and other details.
  - Storing this data in MongoDB for later use or analysis.

#### 4. **Data Insertion and Retrieval**:
Once the faces are detected and recognized, and VK profiles are scraped, the results are stored in the **MongoDB database**. The application supports:
  - Inserting face recognition results (rectangles and descriptors).
  - Retrieving previously stored data (e.g., recognition results or scraped VK profile data).

### Face Recognition Process (Detailed Workflow):

1. **Face Detection**:
   - The system starts by loading an image (JPEG format) and uses **dlib’s frontal face detector** to detect faces.
   - The faces are returned as **rectangles** (bounding boxes) in the image.

2. **Face Landmark Detection**:
   - For each detected face, the **shape predictor model** is used to locate the facial landmarks (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth) that define the structure of the face.
   - These landmarks are used to **align** the face, ensuring that recognition occurs on a well-aligned face, reducing potential errors caused by angle, pose, or lighting.

3. **Face Descriptor Generation**:
   - After alignment, the system generates a **128-dimensional descriptor** (feature vector) for each face using **dlib’s ResNet-based face recognition model**.
   - This descriptor uniquely represents the face and can be used for comparing and matching faces.

4. **Storing Results**:
   - The system stores the **bounding box** (rectangle) and the **descriptor** (feature vector) for each detected face in the MongoDB database.
   - These descriptors can later be used to compare against other faces to identify or verify individuals.

5. **External Integration**:
   - The face recognition system is exposed to external applications via a **C interface**. This interface allows calling the recognition functions from a C-based program, passing image data, and retrieving face detection results (bounding boxes and descriptors).

### Error Handling:
The project is designed with robust error handling to handle:
  - **MongoDB connection errors** (e.g., invalid credentials or unreachable database).
  - **Image loading errors** (e.g., invalid image format or corrupt data).
  - **Face recognition errors** (e.g., failure to detect faces or generate descriptors).

These errors are communicated through **error codes and messages**, allowing users or external systems to handle exceptions appropriately.

### Conclusion:
This project combines **image processing**, **face recognition**, **web scraping**, and **MongoDB storage** into a unified Go-based application. The face recognition component, powered by **dlib**, is the core feature, enabling the system to detect and recognize faces in images and store the results for later use. This makes the system ideal for use cases such as **identity verification**, **profile analysis**, **surveillance**, and any other scenario requiring **automated face recognition**.
